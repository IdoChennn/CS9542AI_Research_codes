4. Methods, system model

Design of system model (ppt picture)
Datasets: 1) description + cleaning. 2) Feature selection (Correlation check, feature scaling, categorical feature to individal features, PCA dimension reduction) 3) Classification (2 labels/4 labels (originaly 7 labels)) 

System model
	
	Using TCP to Simulating FL	
	
	Comparing different DL models + loss function
		FL use different DL model (NN, networks...)
	
	Comparing different FL algorithm + math function
		Fed_avg and Fed_prox
	
	Clients (model updates) and server(aggregated model) encryption
	
Results
	
	Comparing different DL models
	
	Comparing different FL algorithm
	
	Clients (model updates) and server(aggregated model) encryption
	
Disscussion:
	
	FL not usble in ML (Decsision tree, random forest)
	Why accuracy for 4 labels is low (Non-idd / data probelms (feature, clearning) )
	FL models in differen sencario
	Fed_prox in what secnario, Fed_avg in what scenario
	Fed_prox + what DL models' Fed_avg + what DL models
	
Conclusion:
	
	Future work: Addressing Non-iid data issue / Covid FL based on Medical images
	
	Conclude everything above
